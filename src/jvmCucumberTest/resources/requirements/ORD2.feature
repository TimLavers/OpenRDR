Feature: Order of Attributes in Case View

  Scenario: Default Attribute order is by order created
    Given I start the client application
    And case CaseA is provided having data:
      | A | a |
    And case CaseAB is provided having data:
      | B | b |
      | A | a |
    And case CaseABC is provided having data:
      | C | c |
      | B | b |
      | A | a |
    When I select case CaseA
    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
      | A |
    When I select case CaseAB
    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
      | A |
      | B |
    When I select case CaseABC
    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
      | A |
      | B |
      | C |
    And stop the client application

  Scenario: Attributes can be re-ordered by drag-and-drop
    Given I start the client application
    And the initial Attribute order is A, B, C
    And case CaseABC is provided having data:
      | A | a |
      | B | b |
      | C | c |
    When I select case CaseABC
    And I move attribute C below attribute A
    And I move attribute A below attribute B
    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
      | C |
      | B |
      | A |
    And stop the client application

  Scenario: New Attributes can be created after an Attribute re-ordering
    Given I start the client application
    And the initial Attribute order is A, B, C
    And case CaseABC is provided having data:
      | A | a |
      | B | b |
      | C | c |
    And I select case CaseABC
    And I move attribute C below attribute A
    And I move attribute A below attribute B
    And the case shows the attributes in order:
      | C |
      | B |
      | A |
    And case CaseABCD is provided having data:
      | A | a |
      | B | b |
      | C | c |
      | D | d |
    When I select case CaseABCD
    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
      | C |
      | B |
      | A |
      | D |
    And stop the client application
