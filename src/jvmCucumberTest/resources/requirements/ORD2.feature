Feature: Order of Attributes in Case View

  @single
#  Scenario: Default Attribute order is by order created
#    Given I start the client application
#    And case CaseA is provided having data:
#      |A|a|
#    And case CaseAB is provided having data:
#      |B|b|
#      |A|a|
#    And case CaseABC is provided having data:
#      |C|c|
#      |B|b|
#      |A|a|
#    And if I select case CaseA
#    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
#      | A |
#    And if I select case CaseAB
#    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
#      | A |
#      | B |
#    And if I select case CaseABC
#    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
#      | A |
#      | B |
#      | C |
#    And stop the client application

  Scenario: Attributes can be re-ordered by drag-and-drop
    Given I start the application and the initial Attribute order is A, B, C
    And case CaseABC is provided having data:
        |A|a|
        |B|b|
        |C|c|
    And if I select case CaseABC
    And I move attribute C below attribute A
    And I move attribute A below attribute B
    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
      | C |
      | B |
      | A |
    And stop the client application

#  Scenario: New Attributes can be created after an Attribute re-ordering
#    Given I start the application and it the initial Attribute order is A, B, C
#    And I select a case with data:
#      |A|a|
#      |B|b|
#      |C|c|
#    And I move attribute C below attribute A
#    And I move attribute A below attribute B
#    And case CaseABCD is provided having data:
#      |A|a|
#      |B|b|
#      |C|c|
#      |D|d|
#    And if I select case CaseABCD
#    Then the case should show the attributes in order:
#      | C |
#      | B |
#      | A |
#      | D |
#    And stop the client application
