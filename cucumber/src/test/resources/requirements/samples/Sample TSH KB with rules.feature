Feature: The knowledge base described in the TSH paper is implemented by a KB built from the TSH sample.

#  We check the interpretation of each of the cases. Just a few of
#  the cases are checked as the other TSH sample cuke checks all of them.
  Scenario: TSH KB rules
    Given I start the client application
    And I create a Knowledge Base with the name TSHNew based on the "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone" sample

    Then the count of the number of cases is 34
    And the KB description is:
