Feature: A sample KB can be created that has the Zoo Animals cases.

  Scenario: Zoo KB cases
    Given I start the client application
    And I create a Knowledge Base with the name ZooCases based on the "Zoo Animals - cases only" sample
    And pause for 2 seconds
    Then the count of the number of cases is 101
    And pause for 1 second
    When I select case aardvark
    Then I see these case values:
      | hair     | true  |  |
      | feathers | false |  |
      | eggs     | false |  |
      | milk     | true  |  |
