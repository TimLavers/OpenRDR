Feature: The cases described in the TSH paper are present in a KB built from the TSH sample.

#  We check the data for each of the cases but only test a few cases
#  for a blank interpretation.

  Scenario: TSH KB cases
    Given I start the client application
    And I create a Knowledge Base with the name TSHCases based on the "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone - cases only" sample
    Then the count of the number of cases is 34
