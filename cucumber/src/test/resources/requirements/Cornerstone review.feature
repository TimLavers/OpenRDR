Feature: Reviewing cornerstone cases
  Scenario: A user message should be shown if there are no cornerstone cases
    Given a new case with the name Case1 is stored on the server
    And I start the client application
    And I enter the text "Go to Bondi." in the interpretation field
    And I select the changes tab
    When I start to build a rule for the change on row 0
    Then the message indicating no cornerstone cases to review should be shown

  Scenario: The first cornerstone case should be shown to the user
    Given a list of cases with the following names is stored on the server:
      | Case1 |
      | Case2 |
    And I start the client application
    And I see the case Case1 as the current case
    And I enter the text "Go to Bondi." in the interpretation field
    And I build a rule for this change
    And I select the case Case2
    And I replace the text in the interpretation field with "Go to Bondi. Grow some trees."
    When I start to build a rule for the change on row 1
    Then the case Case1 is shown as the cornerstone case

  Scenario: The user should be able to switch to the next cornerstone case
    Given case Case1 is provided having data:
      | x | 1 |
    And case Case2 is provided having data:
      | x | 2 |
    And case Case3 is provided having data:
      | x | 3 |
    And the interpretation of the case Case1 includes "Comment 1." because of condition "x is not blank"
    And the interpretation of the case Case2 includes "Comment 2." because of condition "x is not blank"
    And the interpretation of the case Case3 includes "Comment 3." because of condition "x is not blank"
    And I start the client application
    And I see the case Case1 as the current case
    And I enter the text " Comment 4." in the interpretation field
    And I start to build a rule for the change on row 0
    And the case Case2 is shown as the cornerstone case
