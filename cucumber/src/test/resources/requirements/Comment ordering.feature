Feature: The user should be able to determine the order of comments in a report

  Scenario: When building a rule to append a comment to the report, the comment should appear at the end of the report
    Given a list of cases with the following names is stored on the server:
      | Case1 |
      | Case2 |
    Given I start the client application
    And I build a rule to add the comment "Go to the beach." for case Case1
    When I build another rule to append the comment "And bring your flippers."
    Then the interpretation should contain the text "Go to the beach. And bring your flippers."
    And I select the case Case2
    And the interpretation should contain the text "Go to the beach. And bring your flippers."
