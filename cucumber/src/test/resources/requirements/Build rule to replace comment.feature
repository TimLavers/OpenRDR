  Scenario: The user should be able to build a rule to replace a comment
    Given a list of cases with the following names is stored on the server:
      | Case1 |
      | Case2 |
    And the interpretation of the case Case1 is "Go to Bondi."
    And I start the client application
    And I should see the case Case1 as the current case
    And  the interpretation should contain the text "Go to Bondi."
    When I build a rule to replace the comment "Go to Bondi." by "Go to Maroubra."
    And  the interpretation should contain the text "Go to Maroubra."
    Then the following comment is shown:
      | Go to Maroubra. |
    And select the case Case2
    And  the interpretation should contain the text "Go to Maroubra."
    And the following comment is shown:
      | Go to Maroubra. |

  Scenario: The user should be able to build a rule to replace a comment with a condition they have selected
    Given case Bondi is provided having data:
      | Wave | poor |
    And case Manly is provided having data:
      | Sun      | hot      |
      | Swimming | pleasant |
    And the interpretation of the case Bondi is "Go to Bondi."
    And I start the client application
    And I select case Manly
    And  the interpretation should contain the text "Go to Bondi."
    When I build a rule to replace the comment "Go to Bondi." by "Go to Manly." with the condition "Sun is in case"
    Then  the interpretation should contain the text "Go to Manly."
    And I select case Bondi
    And  the interpretation should contain the text "Go to Bondi."
    And stop the client application

  Scenario: The conditions shown for a comment that is a replacement should include the conditions for the comment that has been replaced
    Given case Bondi is provided having data:
      | Sun  | too hot |
      | Wave | poor    |
    And I start the client application
    And I build a rule to add the comment "Go to Bondi." with the condition "Wave is in case"
    And I build a rule to replace the comment "Go to Bondi." by "Go to Manly." with the condition "Sun is in case"
    And click on the Comments tab
    Then the conditions showing are:
      | Wave is in case |
      | Sun is in case  |
    And stop the client application

  Scenario: A comment given for the case must be selected before the user can start a rule to replace it
    Given a case with name Case1 is stored on the server
    And the interpretation of the case Case1 is "Go to Bondi."
    And I start the client application
