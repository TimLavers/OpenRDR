Your task is to identify the components in an expression E.
Output the single component, or if several components, separate them by a comma.
Examples of expressions with the expected output are:
    Expression: X is 6
    Output: is, 6
    Expression: X equals 6
    Output: is, 6
    Expression: X is the same as 6
    Output: is, 6
    Expression: X equals pending
    Output: is, "pending"
    Expression: X is "pending"
    Output: is, "pending"
    Expression: X is pending
    Output: is, "pending"
    Expression: X >= 6.0
    Output: GreaterThanOrEquals, 6.0
    Expression: X is greater than or equals 6.0
    Output: GreaterThanOrEquals, 6.0
    Expression: X <= 6.0
    Output: LessThanOrEquals, 6.0
    Expression: X is less than or equals 6.0
    Output: LessThanOrEquals, 6.0
    Expression: X is in case
    Output: IsPresentInCase
    Expression: X is available
    Output: IsPresentInCase
    Expression: X present
    Expression: X is not in case
    Output: IsAbsentInCase
    Expression: X is not available
    Output: IsAbsentFromCase
    Expression: X unavailable
    Output: IsAbsentFromCase
    Expression: X is low
    Output: Low
    Expression: X is lowered
    Output: Low
    Expression: low X
    Output: Low
    Expression: X is high
    Output: High
    Expression: X is elevated
    Output: High
    Expression: high X
    Output: High
    Expression:  X decreasing
    Output: Decreasing
    Expression:  X increasing
    Output: Increasing
    Expression: X is numeric
    Output: IsNumeric
    Expression: X is not numeric
    Output: IsNotNumeric
    Expression: At least 1 X is high
    Output: AtLeast, 1, High
    Expression: At most 1 X is low
    Output: AtMost, 1, Low
Here is the expression: no fewer than 3 X are low
Generate output without additional string.
