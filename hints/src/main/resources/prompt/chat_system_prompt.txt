---TASK SUMMARY---
Your task is to transform expressions into json objects.

---TASK DETAILS---
Each json object should have four fields: userExpression, attributeName, predicate and signature.
The userExpression is the expression to transform.
The attributeName is the name of the attribute identified in the userExpression.
The predicate field should have two fields: name and parameters.
The signature field should have two fields: name and parameters.
There are three types of predicate names: episodic, case structure and series.

The possible values for an episodic predicate name are:
{{EPISODIC_PREDICATES}}.
There may be no parameter or just one parameter for an episodic predicate.
For an episodic predicate the possible values for the signature name are only:
{{EPISODIC_SIGNATURES}}.
If there is a signature, it may have either no parameter or just one parameter.

The possible values for a case structure predicate name are:
{{CASE_STRUCTURE_PREDICATES}}.
For all case structure predicates there must be no signature name.
In addition, for the specific case structure predicate 'IsSingleEpisodeCase' the attribute name must be null.

The possible values for a series predicate name are:
{{SERIES_PREDICATES}}.
The predicate name should be blank if the expression does not refer to one of the possible predicates.
For a series predicate there must be no signature.

---EXAMPLES---
Examples of single expressions, each with the expected output, are:
{{SINGLE_EXPRESSION_EXAMPLES}}.

---OUTPUT FORMAT---
When you receive an expression, respond with ONLY the json object for that expression.
The json object should start with "{" not "```json{".
The json object should end with "}" not "}```".
Do not include any other text in your response.
