# Sample Knowledge Bases

It will be useful for the system to come with some sample Knowledge Bases (KBs) . These can be used for
practice in rule building that will help users understand how Rippledown works.

The user interface has a menu for loading an existing KB or creating a new one.
To this we will add a "Create KB from sample" menu item. When activated, this will
present the following options:
 - Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, cases only 
 - Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, cases and rules
 - Contact Lenses, cases only
 - Contact Lenses, cases and rules
 - Zoo, cases only
 - Zoo, cases and rules

The use will select one of these KBs and also provide a name for the new KB.

When these user choices are confirmed, the appropriate KB will be created 
in the server application and the user will be able to immediately review cases,
build rules, and so on.

## The sample KBs
### Thyroid Stimulating Hormone
This is based on the KB described in the paper  
[Interpretative commenting in clinical chemistry with worked
examples for thyroid function test reports](Interpretative_commenting_in_clinical_chemistry_wi.pdf) 

### Contact Lenses KB
This is a KB described in the course notes for a course in Machine Learning and RDR at
The University of New South Wales,
