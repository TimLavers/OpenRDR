# Goals
Our goal with OpenRDR is to build a open source implementation of RippleDown that
can be used for education and research.

## First release
For our first release we aim to implement the rules described in the paper
[Interpretative commenting in clinical chemistry with worked
examples for thyroid function test reports](Interpretative_commenting_in_clinical_chemistry_wi.pdf) 
as a simple RippleDown Knowledge Base (KB).
This paper, by Samuel Vasikaran and Tze Ping Loh, 
appeared in the journal Practical Laboratory Medicine,
volume 26 (2021), and is included in the requirements directory.
The KB will be the basis of a simple Clinical Decision Support System.

This release will be called `milestone1` and the requirements
for it are documented in [Milestone 1 Requirements](milestone1_requirements.md)
