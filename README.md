# OpenRDR

An open source knowledge acquisition system using the RippleDown approach.

RippleDown Rules (RDR) was initially developed by [Paul Compton](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~compton/) in the 1980s. A
good introduction is provided in "A Philosophical Basis for Knowledge Acquisition." Compton, P and Jansen, R, 1990.
*Knowledge Acquisition* 2:241-257.

A comprehensive description is given in his
book ["Ripple-Down Rules, the Alternative to Machine Learning"](https://www.amazon.com.au/Ripple-Down-Rules-Alternative-Machine-Learning-ebook/dp/B092KVD3HQ)
Paul Compton and Byeong Ho Kang, 2021. CRC Press.

## Requirements documentation

The background, requirements, design principles, and so on to the project are documented in the
`documentation` directory that is a sibling to this file. The starting point for the
documentation is [OpenRDR](./documentation/openrdr.md).

## Setup
### Platform
OpenRDR is written in Kotlin and built with Gradle. 
Java version 21 and Gradle need to be installed for OpenRDR development.

### Database
OpenRDR uses Postgres as its persistence provider. The following environment variables are required in order to
allow connection to the Postgres server:

- `OPEN_RDR_DB_URL`: the url of the Postgres server
- `OPEN_RDR_DB_USER`: name of a user with database creation, modification and deletion privileges
- `OPEN_RDR_DB_PASSWORD`: password for the user above.

The default values for the Postgres parameters are `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres`, `postgres`
and `postgres`.

### Google Gemini

OpenRDR uses Google Gemini to generate rule conditions from user-entered expressions.
For this feature to work, and for the associated tests to pass, a Google API key is required and needs to be set
as the value of an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`. To create a Google API key, see
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys" title="close icons">Manage API keys</a>

## Development
Import the Gradle project into IntelliJ.

## Running the tests
There are two layers of tests:

| Test type         | Gradle verification task | 
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| jvm unit tests    | test                     |    
| cucumber tests    | cucumberTest             | 

To run the unit tests, call the `test` task for each of the subprojects: 
- `./gradlew common:test`
- `./gradlew hints:test`
- `./gradlew sesrver:test`
- `./gradlew ui:test`

The cucumber tests build a fat jar and run it in a separate JVM to the client. The client is controlled
and interrogated by the test code using the accessibility API. To run the cucumber tests 
call `./gradlew cucumber:cucumberTest`.
To run a single cucumber test or feature file, add the @single annotation at the start of the 
scenario or feature file and run the `cucumberSingleTest` task.
